            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>
                The reason behind this website is so I can document my life in software development. I began learning the essentials of software development along with python in my first semester, now in my second semester im learning front-end development, JavaScript, and react. Please keep in mind this is only a basic website right now but will get better over time! I am really looking to forward to learning more in the future so I can document it on this site!
