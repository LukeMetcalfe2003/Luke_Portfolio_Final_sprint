            <p>
                Hello, my name is Luke Metcalfe. I'm a second semester student at Keyin College studying Software Development. I'm from Conception Bay South, Newfoundland. Iâ€™ve recently discovered a passion for programming and I am looking forward to seeing where my life goes in the industry. Growing up I played many sports, including hockey, basketball, and softball. Along with my passion for sports, I also enjoy playing video games.

            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>
                I created this website with the purpose of documenting my life in Software Development. I began learning the essentials of Software Development along with Python in my first semester. Now in my second semester, I'm learning Front-End Development, JavaScript, and React. Please keep in mind that this is currently just a basic website and will get better over time. I am really looking forward to learning more in the future so that I can document it on this website.
